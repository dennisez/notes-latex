# TeX files

This is a repository for the `LaTeX` code of some of my personal notes. Currently:

* *Some geometric aspects of non-linear sigma models* (my Master's thesis as presented August 2016)
* *Introduction to Supersymmetry* (still in preparation together with N. Berkovits and I. Reyes)

Hopefully, compiled files will be available at [my homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/dennisez).
